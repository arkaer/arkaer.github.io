Let's go.

TODO:
- Write a somewhat coherent, principled and organized version of this page.

Let's do a list of a few bullet points that we think are somewhat relevant regarding what we want to talk about.

- There are a lot of things we want to explore. Somehow having a place to talk about these is useful - so that we can add some legibility into this exploration space, and so that we can actually have some clarity on targets to move towards, and enough clarity towards targets we can let go of.
- It turns out that one of the skills I want to better develop is to actually produce more deployed software and deployed insights. Therefore enforcing a bias towards online production and deployment will be helpful for me here.
- There are all sorts of pitfalls that I faced before. I don't think it is worth discussing them all, but it might be good to list a few pointers here.
- One of the greatest challenges for me is to somehow make things practical, concrete, and well-scoped. It might be worth considering biases towards action, towards incompleteness, and towards artificial scoping constraints. (That comes with its own challenges and balacing goals as well).



## Art 1

 "Project selection is a subtle art - not a search for immediate excitement, but a careful cultivation of conditions where excitement can grow. The clarity comes from walking the path, not from seeing the destination."


1. Trust the Process
- Accept that finding excitement is possible, even when currently in a non-excited state
- Stay patient; don't let past discouragements contaminate present possibilities

2. Recognize the Vibration
- True excitement is unmistakable - it's a clear state of being
- There's a difference between "might be exciting if explored" and genuine present excitement
- Pay close attention to catch these moments when they arise

3. Double Down on Real Excitement
- When you feel that unmistakable vibration, capture it
- Don't let exciting possibilities slip away due to practicality concerns or past disappointments

4. Navigate Loss of Excitement Wisely
- If excitement fades, pause and reassess
- Return to step 1 rather than forcing continuation
- Exception: Known reliable "excitement triggers" (like your friend visit example) where the pattern is proven

## Art 2

Act now act small act true



"The smallest action beats the grandest plan"  
"Start stupid small, get surprisingly far"  
"One line of code moves mountains"  
"Done beats perfect, small beats stuck"  
"Five minutes of doing beats five hours of worry"  
"Open the IDE, write one line"  
"Start before you're ready, stay before you're done"  
"The dumbest first step beats the smartest excuse"  
"Move first, momentum follows"  
"Just write the damn print statement"
