Let's go.

TODO:
- Write a somewhat coherent, principled and organized version of this page.

Let's do a list of a few bullet points that we think are somewhat relevant regarding what we want to talk about.

- There are a lot of things we want to explore. Somehow having a place to talk about these is useful - so that we can add some legibility into this exploration space, and so that we can actually have some clarity on targets to move towards, and enough clarity towards targets we can let go of.
- It turns out that one of the skills I want to better develop is to actually produce more deployed software and deployed insights. Therefore enforcing a bias towards online production and deployment will be helpful for me here.
- There are all sorts of pitfalls that I faced before. I don't think it is worth discussing them all, but it might be good to list a few pointers here.
- One of the greatest challenges for me is to somehow make things practical, concrete, and well-scoped. It might be worth considering biases towards action, towards incompleteness, and towards artificial scoping constraints. (That comes with its own challenges and balacing goals as well).
